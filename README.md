# PatentScout AI

## AI-Powered Patent Intelligence and Innovation Discovery Platform

PatentScout AI is a Multi-Agent Artificial Intelligence platform designed to discover innovation opportunities by analyzing the gap between emerging academic research and existing patent landscapes.

The platform combines Research Intelligence, Patent Intelligence, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Vector Databases, Semantic Search, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify promising areas for innovation and potential patent opportunities.

Unlike traditional patent search systems that only retrieve patents, PatentScout AI answers a much more valuable question:

> **"What should be patented next?"**

# Problem Statement

Researchers, startups, innovators, and organizations face a common challenge:

* Academic research is growing rapidly across every technology domain.
* Millions of patents already exist worldwide.
* Understanding both research trends and patent saturation requires significant expertise and manual effort.
* Existing tools typically focus on either research discovery or patent search, but rarely combine both.

As a result, identifying genuine innovation opportunities becomes difficult.

PatentScout AI solves this problem by connecting academic research with patent intelligence and automatically identifying under-patented areas with strong research momentum.

---

# Project Vision

PatentScout AI aims to become an intelligent innovation discovery platform that helps:

* Researchers discover commercialization opportunities.
* Startups identify potential patentable ideas.
* Organizations monitor emerging technologies.
* R&D teams discover innovation gaps.
* Investors identify future technology opportunities.

The ultimate goal is to transform large volumes of research papers and patents into actionable innovation intelligence.
